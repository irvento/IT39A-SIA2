A report about an article named "Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the Industry: Case Study of a Partnership with Amazon Web Services Academy",


By reading the article's Abstract and Introduction, I found out that:

- This article is about case study that talks about how collaborating with the Amazon Web Services Academy and how it improves the students' experiences in learning, job preparations, and engagements, to help students become more employable by adding practical, real-world training and resources to their cloud computing course.

- The rise in university's tuition fees, particularly in the UK and USA, has led students and parents to demand better educational quality, resources, and job opportunities to justify the costs of what they hav payed. The introduction highlights efforts to redesign a cloud computing curriculum at Queen Mary University of London in partnership with AWS Academy, incorporating industry-focused hands-on labs and best practices to align with real-world IT environments. Through this collaboration, students gained practical skills, exposure and opportunities to career paths, and support from AWS experts, enhancing their employability ratein the cloud computing field.


The contents of the second part which is Employability and Work-Based Learning that talkles about the integration of industry-oriented curricula, e-learning platforms, and hands-on practice significantly enhances employability and work-based learning outcomes by equipping students with the skills, knowledge, and experience required to meet industry demands effectively.

Industrial Orientation and Practice-Based Learning:
    - Employer involvement in designing degree curricula ensures the inclusion of relevant employability skills,
     leading to improved graduate employment rates. A well-defined curriculum, developed in collaboration with industry,
      prepares students to meet workforce demands effectively. 

    - According to Mason et al. they defined “employability” as “‘work-readiness’; that is, possession of the skills, knowledge,
     attitudes and commercial understanding that will enable new graduates to make productive contributions to organisational 
     objectives soon after commencing employment”. meaning that graduates must have the skills, knowledge, and attitude to contribute 
     effectively to a company's goals right after starting a job.

    - The success of engaging industry in curriculum design depends on defining and embedding the right skill sets into the 
    curriculum to produce graduates prepared to meet workforce demands.

E-Learning and Hands-on Experience:
    - Blended learning approaches that combine theoretical knowledge with practical skills acquisition enhance student motivation
     and employability. E-learning platforms, like AWS Academy, provide authentic environments and resources
      tailored to industry needs, fostering technical competence.

    - E-learning platforms integrated with in-house curricula enhance student engagement and enable performance prediction 
    through multi-user and multi-disciplinary functionalities. Platforms like AWS Academy LMS align learning resources with 
    industry requirements, addressing skill gaps in areas such as cloud computing, IoT, and data analytics.

Student Engagement and High-Quality Student Experience:
- User-friendly e-learning dashboards improve student navigation and engagement, while integrated analytics tools predict performance. Social and interactive elements in LMSs create a lively learning environment, enhancing STEM education through virtual labs.
