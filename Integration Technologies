A report about an article named "Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the Industry: Case Study of a Partnership with Amazon Web Services Academy",

by reading the article's Abstract and Introduction, I found out that:

- This article is about case study that talks about how collaborating with the Amazon Web Services Academy and how it improves the students' experiences in learning, job preparations, and engagements, to help students become more employable by adding practical, real-world training and resources to their cloud computing course.

- The rise in university's tuition fees, particularly in the UK and USA, has led students and parents to demand better educational quality, resources, and job opportunities to justify the costs of what they hav payed. The introduction highlights efforts to redesign a cloud computing curriculum at Queen Mary University of London in partnership with AWS Academy, incorporating industry-focused hands-on labs and best practices to align with real-world IT environments. Through this collaboration, students gained practical skills, exposure and opportunities to career paths, and support from AWS experts, enhancing their employability ratein the cloud computing field.
