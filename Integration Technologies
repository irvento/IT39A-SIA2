A report about an article named "Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the Industry: Case Study of a Partnership with Amazon Web Services Academy",


By reading the article's Abstract and Introduction, I found out that:

- This article is about case study that talks about how collaborating with the Amazon Web Services Academy and how it improves the students' experiences in learning, job preparations, and engagements, to help students become more employable by adding practical, real-world training and resources to their cloud computing course.

- The rise in university's tuition fees, particularly in the UK and USA, has led students and parents to demand better educational quality, resources, and job opportunities to justify the costs of what they hav payed. The introduction highlights efforts to redesign a cloud computing curriculum at Queen Mary University of London in partnership with AWS Academy, incorporating industry-focused hands-on labs and best practices to align with real-world IT environments. Through this collaboration, students gained practical skills, exposure and opportunities to career paths, and support from AWS experts, enhancing their employability ratein the cloud computing field.


The contents of the second part which is Employability and Work-Based Learning that talkles about the integration of industry-oriented curricula, e-learning platforms, and hands-on practice significantly enhances employability and work-based learning outcomes by equipping students with the skills, knowledge, and experience required to meet industry demands effectively.

Industrial Orientation and Practice-Based Learning:
    - Employer involvement in designing degree curricula ensures the inclusion of relevant employability skills,
     leading to improved graduate employment rates. A well-defined curriculum, developed in collaboration with industry,
      prepares students to meet workforce demands effectively. 

    - According to Mason et al. they defined “employability” as “‘work-readiness’; that is, possession of the skills, knowledge,
     attitudes and commercial understanding that will enable new graduates to make productive contributions to organisational 
     objectives soon after commencing employment”. meaning that graduates must have the skills, knowledge, and attitude to contribute 
     effectively to a company's goals right after starting a job.

    - The success of engaging industry in curriculum design depends on defining and embedding the right skill sets into the 
    curriculum to produce graduates prepared to meet workforce demands.

E-Learning and Hands-on Experience:
    - Blended learning approaches that combine theoretical knowledge with practical skills acquisition enhance student motivation
     and employability. E-learning platforms, like AWS Academy, provide authentic environments and resources
      tailored to industry needs, fostering technical competence.

    - E-learning platforms integrated with in-house curricula enhance student engagement and enable performance prediction 
    through multi-user and multi-disciplinary functionalities. Platforms like AWS Academy LMS align learning resources with 
    industry requirements, addressing skill gaps in areas such as cloud computing, IoT, and data analytics.

Student Engagement and High-Quality Student Experience:
- User-friendly e-learning dashboards improve student navigation and engagement, while integrated analytics tools predict performance. Social and interactive elements in LMSs create a lively learning environment, enhancing STEM education through virtual labs.


For the Third part wihch is Context of the Study: Designing Cloud Computing Lectures. The main finding is the study integrates AWS Academy resources into QMUL’s curriculum to enhance hands-on skillls and career readiness in cloud computing. It includes core topics like scalability and big data, along with emerging technologies like GPUs and CUDA programming. The curriculum also maps career paths to necessary skills, offering students a roadmap for employability.

- It emphasizes nine popular cloud computing career paths and outlines the necessary training and skills for students to succeed in each path.

- It lists different cloud computing jobs and shows what training, skills, and knowledge are needed for each role, along with their average salaries. Key skills like JavaScript, problem-solving, and system scripting are important across various jobs. The study also highlights that roles in cloud security, virtualisation, and big data have high demand and offer good salaries.

- It highlights the value of creativity, problem-solving, and lifelong learning for employment in cloud computing, all of which are incorporated into the lab and instructional materials. Students were given the opportunity and a chance to talk about their professional aspirations at a workshop that helped them appreciate the importance of their education and the possible advantages of interacting with industry.
 

HOW THe LITERATURE SUPPORTS OR CHALLENGES RESEARCH PROBLEMS
    Assuming I am a researcher where in my research study correlates with the literature or article.
    This report on the literature supports research problems by addressing how university-industry collaboration, specifically with AWS Academy, enhances student employability and prepares graduates for the workforce. The research problem likelly centers on the challenge of improving graduate employability in the rapidly evolving field of cloud computing, where traditional curricula may not be sufficient to meet industry demands. By integrating industry-relevant training, hands-on labs, and real-world skills into the curriculum, the study demonstrates  how collaboration with AWS Academy addresses this gap, improving student performance, confidence, and employability. This partnership and collaboration provides a solution to the problem of ensuring that graduates possess the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in cloud computing roles, which are in high demand in the job market or in the fields.


GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES
    The report highlights gaps such as the limited career paths covered in the literature, lack of emphasis on soft skills, and the focus on short-term student performance without assessing long-term career outcomes. There is also an opportunity to expand the curriculum to include emerging technologies, integrate soft skills training, and broaden the university-industry partnership model globally. Additionally, long-term tracking of graduates and expanding collaborations with other tech companies could further enhance employability and provide valuable insights.

THE MAIN FINDINGS
    According to the report, it is crucial to update the curriculum every year to reflect rapidly evolving technologies and guarantee that graduates have the skills and are prepared for the workforce. Working together with AWS Academy, the biggest cloud provider globally, gave the curriculum access to state-of-the-art cloud computing technology. Because of this collaboration, students performed better and felt more comfortable utilizing cloud technology, which justified the tuition cost rise.

    Since students believed the practical laboratories increased their employability, the university-industry partnership resulted in enhanced student performance and increased confidence in cloud technology. The collaboration increased students' confidence in landing employment after graduation and helped them gain real-world skills. Along with learning about several job options, students also had the chance to obtain certifications through AWS.
